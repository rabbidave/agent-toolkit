# PayPal Agent Toolkit

###### OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, Vercel's AI SDK, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrated with PayPal APIs through function calling. 

###### This toolkit also features an industry-leading, risk-based Zero-Trust security model for sensitive operations.

###### For a detailed explanation of this enhancement, please see the **Addendum** at the end of this document.

## Available tools

###### For a detailed overview of the data classification methodology, please see the following:

[**Local-First Data Classification**](https://github.com/rabbidave/LatentSpace.Tools/blob/main/classify.md).

###### Each tool is assigned a data sensitivity classification which determines the required security flow. 

###### This risk-based approach ensures that sensitive operations are protected with a Zero-Trust handshake, while less sensitive operations remain efficient.

## TypeScript

### Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just want to use the package run:

```bash
npm install @paypal/agent-toolkit

```

### Requirements

Node 18+

### Usage

The library needs to be configured with your account's client id and secret which is available in your PayPal Developer Dashboard. **For operations involving sensitive data, see the Security Addendum below.**

The toolkit works with Vercel's AI SDK and can be passed as a list of tools. For more details, refer our examples

```typescript
import { PayPalAgentToolkit } from '@paypal/agent-toolkit/ai-sdk';
const paypalToolkit = new PayPalAgentToolkit({
  clientId: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET,
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      invoices: {
        create: true,
        list: true,
        send: true,
        sendReminder: true,
        cancel: true,
        generateQRC: true,
      },
      products: { create: true, list: true, update: true },
      subscriptionPlans: { create: true, list: true, show: true },
      shipment: { create: true, show: true, cancel: true },
      orders: { create: true, get: true },
      disputes: { list: true, get: true },
    },
  },
});

```

### Initializing the Workflows

```typescript
import { PayPalWorkflows, ALL_TOOLS_ENABLED } from '@paypal/agent-toolkit/ai-sdk';
const paypalWorkflows = new PayPalWorkflows({
  clientId: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET,
  configuration: {
    actions: ALL_TOOLS_ENABLED,
  },
});

```

### Using the toolkit

```typescript
const llm: LanguageModelV1 = getModel(); // The model to be used with ai-sdk
const { text: response } = await generateText({
  model: llm,
  tools: paypalToolkit.getTools(),
  maxSteps: 10,
  prompt: `Create an order for $50 for custom handcrafted item and get the payment link.`,
});

```

## PayPal Model Context Protocol

The PayPal Model Context Protocol server allows you to integrate with PayPal APIs through function calling. This protocol supports various tools to interact with different PayPal services.

### Running MCP Inspector

To run the PayPal MCP server using npx, use the following command:

```bash
npx -y @paypal/mcp --tools=all PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT="SANDBOX"

```

Replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with active access token generated using these steps: PayPal access token. Alternatively, you could set the PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in your environment variables.

### Custom MCP Server

You can set up your own MCP server. For example:

```typescript
import { PayPalAgentToolkit } from “@paypal/agent-toolkit/modelcontextprotocol";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const orderSummary = await paypalWorkflows.generateOrder(
  llm,
  transactionInfo,
  merchantInfo,
);

const server = new PayPalAgentToolkit({
	accessToken: process.env.PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
});

async function main() {
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);
  console.error("PayPal MCP Server running on stdio");
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error("Fatal error in main():", error);
  process.exit(1);
});

```

### Usage with MCP host (Claude Desktop/Cline/Cursor/Github Co-Pilot)

This guide explains how to integrate the PayPal connector with Claude Desktop.

**Prerequisites**

* Claude Desktop application installed
* installing Node.js locally

**Installation Steps**

1. **Install Node.js**
   Node.js is required for the PayPal connector to function:
   * Visit the Node.js official website, download and install it.
   * Requirements: Node 18+

2. **Configure PayPal Connector with MCP host (Claude desktop / Cursor / Cline)**
We will show the integration with Claude desktop. You can use your favorite MCP host.

* Open Claude Desktop
* Navigate to Settings
* Find the Developer or Advanced settings section
* Locate the external tools or connectors configuration area
* Add the following PayPal connector configuration to this `~/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
     "paypal": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": [
         "-y",
         "@paypal/mcp",
         "--tools=all"
       ],
       "env": {
         "PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
         "PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT": "SANDBOX"
       }
     }
   }
}

```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual PayPal Access Token. Alternatively, you could set the `PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` as an environment variable. You can also pass it as an argument using `--access-token` in `"args"` Set `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT` value as either `SANDBOX` for stage testing and `PRODUCTION` for production environment.

* Save your configuration changes

3. **Test the Integration**
   * Quit and restart Claude Desktop to apply changes
   * Test the connection by asking Claude to perform a PayPal-related task
   * Example: "List my PayPal invoices"

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used:

* __PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN__: Your PayPal Access Token
* __PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT__: Set to `SANDBOX` for sandbox mode, `PRODUCTION` for production (defaults to `SANDBOX` mode)

This guide explains how to generate an access token for PayPal API integration, including how to find your client ID and client secret.

**Prerequisites**

* PayPal Developer account (for Sandbox)
* PayPal Business account (for production)

**Finding Your Client ID and Client Secret**

1. **Create a PayPal Developer Account**:
   * Go to PayPal Developer Dashboard
   * Sign up or log in with your PayPal credentials

2. **Access Your Credentials**:
   * In the Developer Dashboard, click on **Apps & Credentials** in the menu
   * Switch between **Sandbox** and **Live** modes depending on your needs

3. **Create or View an App**:
   * To create a new app, click **Create App**
   * Give your app a name and select a Business account to associate with it
   * For existing apps, click on the app name to view details

4. **Retrieve Credentials**:
   * Once your app is created or selected, you'll see a screen with your:
      * **Client ID**: A public identifier for your app
      * **Client Secret**: A private key (shown after clicking "Show")

   * Save these credentials securely as they are required for generating access tokens

**Generating an Access Token**
*Using cURL*

```bash
curl -v https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Language: en_US" \
  -u "CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials"

```

Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual credentials. For production, use `https://api-m.paypal.com` instead of the sandbox URL.

*Using Postman*

1. Create a new request to `https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token`
2. Set method to `POST`
3. Under **Authorization**, select **Basic Auth** and enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Under __Body__, select `x-www-form-urlencoded` and add a key `grant_type` with value `client_credentials`
5. Send the request

**Response**
A successful response will look like:

```json
{
  "scope": "...",
  "access_token": "Your Access Token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "app_id": "APP-80W284485P519543T",
  "expires_in": 32400,
  "nonce": "..."
}

```

Copy the `access_token` value for use in your Claude Desktop integration.

**Token Details**

* Sandbox Tokens: Valid for 3-8 hours
* Production Tokens: Valid for 8 hours
* It's recommended to implement token refresh logic before expiration

__Using the Token with Claude Desktop__
Once you have your access token, update the `PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` value in your Claude Desktop connector configuration:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT": "SANDBOX"
  }
}

```

**Best Practices**

* Store client ID and client secret securely
* Implement token refresh logic to handle token expiration
* Use environment-specific tokens (sandbox for testing, production for real transactions)
* Avoid hardcoding tokens in application code

## Addendum: Zero-Trust Architecture

```json

```

To provide industry-leading security for financial operations, this toolkit implements a **risk-based, dual-flow security model**. Instead of treating all operations equally, we classify them by data sensitivity and route them through the appropriate security flow. This ensures that high-risk actions like sending money are protected by a state-of-the-art handshake protocol, while low-risk actions remain simple and efficient.

### The Core Abstraction: `executeSecureTool`

As a developer, you don't need to manually manage which security flow to use. The complexity is handled by a single orchestrator function: `executeSecureTool`. This function acts as a smart router, inspecting the tool's classification and directing the request to the correct backend.

The high-level design of this dual-flow architecture is as follows:

```ascii
┌─────────────────┐                        ┌──────────────────┐
│   AI Assistant  │                        │ Standard MCP 2.1 │
│ (Orchestrator)  │◄─── Session Token ─────┤   Authorization  │
└─────────┬───────┘                        └──────────────────┘
          │
          ├─ Class 4-5 (e.g., list_invoices)
          │                      │
          └──────────────────────► (Standard, Low-Friction Flow)
          │
          ├─ Class 1-3 (e.g., create_refund, create_order)
          │                      │
          └──────────────────────► (Zero-Trust, High-Security Flow)
                                 │
                         ┌──────────────────┐
                         │ Zero-Trust MCP   │
                         │ Extension Service│
                         └──────────────────┘

### Tool Classifications

The routing logic is driven by a simple, explicit mapping of tools to their data sensitivity classes. This design choice makes the system's security posture transparent and easily extensible. It also creates a foundation for future AI-driven, real-time risk classification using NLP models like DistilBERT.

<details>

```typescript
/**
 * Defines the data classification for each financial API tool.
 * This mapping is the single source of truth for security routing.
 */
export const TOOL_CLASSIFICATIONS: Record<string, number> = {
  // Class 1: PII Operations (Highest Sensitivity)
  "create_subscription": 1,

  // Class 2: Sensitive Financial Transactions
  "pay_order": 2,

### The Zero-Trust Handshake (Class 1-3 Operations)

For all sensitive operations, the toolkit enforces a **two-phase handshake protocol** that ensures zero standing privileges. A standard access token is not enough to execute a sensitive transaction.

```ascii

         |  4. result <-------------------------------------------|

```

<br>
<details>
<summary><strong>Why This Handshake is Safer</strong></summary>

* **Zero Standing Privileges:** The `ephemeralToken` is not a general-purpose key. It is a single-use authorization, cryptographically bound to one specific user, for one specific tool, with one specific set of parameters. It is useless for anything else.
* **Replay Protection:** The token is consumed atomically from a state store (like Redis) on its first use. Any attempt to replay the request with the same token will fail, as the token will no longer exist. It also expires after a very short time (e.g., 30 seconds).
* **Parameter Integrity:** By hashing the parameters and binding the hash to the token, we guarantee that a man-in-the-middle attacker cannot alter the transaction details (like the amount or recipient) between the authorization and execution phases.
* **Defense in Depth:** This multi-step verification process ensures that even if one layer were compromised (e.g., a session token was stolen), the attacker still could not execute a sensitive transaction without passing the subsequent, transaction-specific checks.
